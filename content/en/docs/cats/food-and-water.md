#### food

Food is in the bin in the front closet next to the litter box. You can fill their food anytime. Make sure to fill both bowls before you leave.

#### water

They like fresh water but they'll be fine. Maybe just refill both water bowls before you leave. They like an ice-cube or two in the water as well.
